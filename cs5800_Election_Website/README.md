# CS5800 â€“ Fundamentals of Software Engineering

## Description

This project combined full-stack web development with practical software engineering methodologies including:

- **Relational database design** using binary ER diagrams and normalization to **3NF**
- **Agile development**, including weekly client meetings
- **Flask-based web application** development with both frontend and backend components
- **Version control and collaboration** in a team setting

Our team designed and implemented a secure, web-based election system that allows:

- **Voters** to securely log in and vote in active elections
- **Admins** to create and manage elections, candidates, and voter access
- **Live election data management**, ensuring accurate user roles and controlled voting flow

### My Contributions

- Participated in the design of the **database schema**, ensuring proper normalization and relationship modeling
- Worked with the team to integrate the schema into the Flask application
- Contributed to both backend logic and frontend layout
- Actively engaged with our professor and TA (acting as clients) during weekly Agile meetings to gather requirements, present progress, and incorporate feedback
