# XR Circuit Simulator

## Description

The XR Circuit Simulator is a Unity-based application for building and analyzing electrical circuits in an XR environment. Users can create circuits using components like resistors, voltage sources, and diodes, and then perform real-time circuit analysis directly within the simulation. The project emphasizes interactive, intuitive component placement and educational insight into electrical behaviors.

This project was developed with support from Xyro Technologies, whose sponsorship and guidance made the project possible.

## Features

- Interactive placement of circuit components through finger-based XR interaction
- Real-time DC analysis using node voltage method with conductance matrices
- Diode modeling with threshold voltage and iterative convergence
- Two-pass resistance calculation for accurate series/parallel analysis
- Automatic terminal merging and connection tracking
- Visual display of voltage, current, and effective resistance
- Extensible design for supporting more component types

## Future Improvements

- Support for AC circuit analysis with impedance calculation
- Save/load functionality for user-created circuits
- Improved interface for selecting and manipulating components
