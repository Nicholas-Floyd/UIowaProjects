# University of Iowa Projects – Nicholas Floyd

## Overview

This repository showcases a selection of major projects I completed during my undergraduate studies in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Iowa. While it doesn’t include every project I worked on—some were lost or submitted through systems that are no longer accessible—it represents the most impactful work I still have available.

Each folder contains a separate project with its own `README.md` that goes into greater detail about the implementation, goals, and lessons learned.

## CS:1210 – Tweet Finder

One of my earliest projects, this application integrates multiple APIs (Google Maps & Twitter) to map tweets based on geolocation data. It features a Python GUI and dynamic map updates.

---

## CS:4400 – Hospital Management

A full-stack database project focused on MySQL schema design, stored procedures, and data normalization (3NF). Includes a Flask frontend with user authentication, patient-physician scheduling, and admin views.

## CS:5800 – Election Website

This was a capstone-style software engineering project built in a group using the AGILE process. It includes a full-stack web app for managing and conducting elections, built with Flask and Sqlite. We conducted weekly meetings with our client (Professor/TA) to simulate a real-world development cycle.

## ECE:3360 – Embedded AC Control System

An embedded systems project using an Arduino Uno, AHT20 temperature sensor, RTC module, and LCD. The system allows users to configure time-based auto-shutoff/on behavior and monitor temperature thresholds using both hardware and software controls.

---

## ECE:4880 – Portfolio Website

A group project aimed at building a personal portfolio website for each team member. I handled all backend logic, including login functionality, password reset flows, and contact forms using Flask. The frontend used a template, though some CSS issues remain unresolved.

## ENGR:1100 – Laser Maze

This was my first multi-week group project. The goal was to build a STEM toy, and we created a laser maze puzzle where users place mirrors to reflect a laser onto a target. Our project was voted best in class.
