# University of Iowa projects -Nicholas Floyd

## Overview 
This repository has some of the projects I worked on over the course of my undergraduate career at Iowa for my Computer Science Engineering degree. This mostly only includes major projects and leaves out smaller things I worked on inbetween. Unfortuately some of my past projects have been lost or the account containing the submissions have been shutdown so this is a list of what I still have. In each folder there will be a README that goes more in depth on the project compared to what is written on this README.

## CS:1210 Tweet Finder
This project was one of the first projects I did in my career and involved using multiple API's to find the location of where a user tweeted something on google maps. 

## CS:4400 Hospital Management
This project for my database systems class and focused more on the use of stored procedures and making and editing tables using MySql. 

## CS:5800 Election Website
This project was for Fundamentals of Software Engineering where I worked in a group setting to heavily mimic a work enviornment for our project. This involved multiple meetings with our client (Professor and TA), and using an AGILE process while using everything we have learned for software development over the years.

## ECE:3360 Embedded Project
This project was my final project for my embedded systems class. The goal was to make an ac system be able to automatically start and stop when reading certain temperatues aswell as having a RTC so users could set what time they want the system to shutoff or on. 

## ECE:4880 Portfolio Website
This project was the last project from my first semester Senior Design class which involved creating a portfolio website my group. 

## ENGR:1100 Laser Maze
This project had the goal of making a STEM toy in which we made a laser maze.
