# ENGR:1100 Laser Maze

## Description

This was my first multi-week group project at the University of Iowa and remains one of my favorites. The objective was to design and prototype a STEM-themed toy or game. My team developed a **laser maze puzzle**, where players use mirrors to reflect a laser from a starting point to a prism at the end of a static maze.

## Project Highlights

- Static maze board with fixed wall layout
- Custom-designed mirror pieces to reflect the laser beam
- Goal: hit a prism by placing mirrors in the correct configuration
- Discussed future improvements such as:
  - Movable walls
  - Elevated mirrors
  - Beam-splitting or redirecting mirror types

Our laser maze was very well-received and was **voted best project in the class**.
